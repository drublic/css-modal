Pure CSS Modals

Please [visit the website](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal) to read more about this project.

## What is it

__Built from pure CSS:__ CSS Modal is built from pure CSS. JavaScript is only for sugar. This makes
it perfectly accessible.

__Optimized for mobile:__ The modals are designed having responsive web in mind. They work on all
screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high resolution screens.

__Use as Sass plugin:__ You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) plugin and apply it to
your custom classes. No need to understand all the code.

__A few other advantages:__ accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and fast!


## How to use

Please visit [the website's section](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#howto-markup)
on how to use CSS Modals.


## Browser Support

This modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. This does not include
Internet Explorer 7 or lower.


## Heads up

Please be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after
hiding the modal.

For extensibility there is an event `cssmodal:show` fired on the modal itself after
the modal is shown.  
Another event `cssmodal:hide` is fired after the modal is hidden.

These events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware and use e.g. jQuery to create custom events.
